# Atopy
Python Autoloader


To use this object, place this file at the root of your project and extend your main class of the Atopy class (also put in the root) and call its __init__ method.

You can also call the Atopy class without inheriting it.

For a "custom" autoloading, create the __export__ method in your .py files and have it return what you want.
